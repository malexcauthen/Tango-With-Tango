# Tango-With-Tango
Tango with Tango helps users to perform the Waltz dance correctly by guiding them through the steps, and giving feedback on how they did. This project was voting a top 7 best project at the Vanderbilt Hackathon in Octover 2015.  

In order to run this application you must have a Google Project Tango Tablet. 

Once the application is installed on your project Tango Device, click the start button. It will take you to a view that shows a 3D rendering, as well as the following fields.
Previous Step:
Current Step:

When the app is ready, it will give you the first step in the Waltz dance which is a forward step. It will then update the Current step to a left step, and previous step to the forward step. It will also let you know if you stepped correctly. The dance repeats until the user ends the application.
